# Tasks: AI Smart Quiz App

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-quiz-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not explicitly requested in feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: Project root with utils/ and database/ directories
- **Paths**: Use absolute paths from repository root

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with Streamlit dependencies in requirements.txt
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure environment variables setup in .env file
- [ ] T004 [P] Create database directory structure
- [ ] T005 [P] Create utils directory structure for modular components

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quiz Taking Experience (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Content Management (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Provide admin interface for managing categories, questions, and CSV import/export

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for question display integration
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for result data

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1 & 2 can start in parallel
- All model creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create User input form component in app.py (name and age fields)"
Task: "Create category selection dropdown in app.py (populated from database)"

# Launch all database functions for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create quiz session management functions in utils/db_manager.py"
Task: "Implement score calculation algorithm in utils/db_manager.py"
Task: "Create result saving functionality in utils/db_manager.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (if tests included)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
