**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "AI Smart Quiz App - Standalone Streamlit application with local SQLite database, quiz functionality, admin panel, voice features using OpenAI TTS, and performance analytics dashboard"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quiz Taking Experience (Priority: P1)

Users can register their name and age, select a quiz category, take a multiple-choice quiz with immediate feedback, and view their final score with performance analytics.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers the primary value of the quiz application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a full quiz cycle from user registration through score display, with all state management working correctly in a single Streamlit session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no user information is entered, **When** user enters name and age and selects a category, **Then** they can start the quiz immediately
2. **Given** a quiz is in progress, **When** user selects an answer and clicks next, **Then** the system progresses to the next question and tracks their answer
3. **Given** all questions are answered, **When** user submits the quiz, **Then** the system calculates score, saves results to database, and displays performance summary

### User Story 2 - Content Management (Priority: P1)

Administrators can add, edit, delete categories and questions through an integrated admin panel, and import/export questions via CSV files.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining quiz content and allowing the application to scale with new questions and topics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding new categories, creating questions with all four options and correct answers, editing existing content, and verifying CSV import/export functionality works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** access to admin panel, **When** administrator creates a new category, **Then** it appears immediately in the category selection dropdown
2. **Given** a category exists, **When** administrator adds questions with all options and correct answer, **Then** those questions are immediately available for quiz sessions
3. **Given** question data in CSV format, **When** administrator imports the file, **Then** all valid questions are added to the database with proper validation

### User Story 3 - Voice-Enabled Quiz Experience (Priority: P2)

Users can click speaker icons to hear questions and answer options read aloud through text-to-speech functionality, with audio playing immediately without file storage.

**Why this priority**: Enhances accessibility and user experience, particularly for users who prefer audio learning or have visual impairments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking speaker icons next to questions and options, verifying that audio plays immediately and no files are permanently stored on the system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a question is displayed, **When** user clicks the speaker icon, **Then** the question text is read aloud immediately
2. **Given** answer options are displayed, **When** user clicks speaker icons next to options, **Then** each option text is read aloud separately
3. **Given** multiple audio requests are made, **When** each request completes, **Then** no permanent audio files remain stored on the local system

### User Story 4 - Performance Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Users can view aggregated performance statistics including average scores per category, attempt counts, and score trends over time through interactive charts.

**Why this priority**: Provides valuable insights into learning progress and quiz performance, helping users identify areas for improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing multiple quizzes across different categories and verifying that dashboard displays accurate, aggregated statistics with interactive visualizations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple quiz results exist, **When** user views the dashboard, **Then** average scores per category are displayed in a bar chart
2. **Given** quiz attempts have been made, **When** user views attempt statistics, **Then** pie chart shows distribution of attempts across categories
3. **Given** quiz history exists, **When** user views score trends, **Then** line chart displays score progression over time
